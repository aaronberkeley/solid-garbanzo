#### **Part 1: File System Navigation and Manipulation**
Complete the following tasks using the command line:
1. Check your current working directory and note the path.
2. Create a new directory called `my_project`.
3. Navigate into the `my_project` directory.
4. Inside `my_project`, create a new text file named `readme.txt`.
5. Open the `readme.txt` file in a text editor (e.g., Nano, Vim) and add the text "This is my first project."
6. Save and exit the editor.
7. Copy the `readme.txt` file to a new file named `info.txt` within the same directory.
8. Move the `info.txt` file to your home directory.
9. Delete the `readme.txt` file.
10. Return to your home directory and list all files to confirm the presence of `info.txt`.

#### **Part 2: Introduction to Git**
Follow these steps to practice using Git for version control:
1. Initialize a new Git repository in the `my_project` directory.
2. Create a new file in the repository called `main.py` and add the following text:  
   ```python
   print("Hello, world!")
   ```
3. Check the current status of your repository.
4. Stage the `main.py` file for commit.
5. Commit the changes with the message "Initial commit."
6. Create a new branch called `feature-branch`.
7. Switch to the `feature-branch`.
8. Update the `main.py` file to print "Hello, Python World!" instead of "Hello, world!".
9. Stage the updated file.
10. Commit the changes in the `feature-branch` with the message "Updated greeting in main.py".
11. Switch back to the `main` branch
12. Merge the `feature-branch` into the `main` branch.
13. Create a new public repo on github called `my_project`.
14. Push the repository to your new GitHub repository.
