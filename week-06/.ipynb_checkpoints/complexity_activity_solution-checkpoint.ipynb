    "# Example 1: Logarithmic\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_digits(n):\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        n //= 10\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "    return count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. The function repeatedly divides `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`).\n",
    "2. Each division reduces the value of `n` by a factor of 10.\n",
    "3. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity:** Θ(log n)\n",
    "- The number of times this loop runs is approximately the number of digits in `n`, which is `log_{10}(n)`.\n",
    "- Thus, the time complexity is **\\( \\Theta(\\log n) \\)** (logarithmic complexity).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimized Version (Constant):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "def count_digits(n):\n",
    "    return math.floor(math.log10(n)) + 1 if n > 0 else 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. The function computes `math.log10(n)`, which finds the logarithm of `n` in base 10.\n",
    "2. The logarithm function in Python runs in **constant time \\( \\Theta(1) \\)** because it is a single mathematical operation.\n",
    "3. The additional operations (`math.floor(...)` and `+1`) are also constant-time operations.\n",
    "4. Since no loops or recursive calls are present, the function does **not** depend on the size of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, the optimized version has a constant time complexity of **\\( \\Theta(1) \\)**.\n"
